title: Component Patterns
description: Content building blocks and layout rules for MindGrid docs.
---

This guide covers the shared components and content patterns used in the
MindGrid documentation. Use these patterns to keep docs consistent and easy to
scan.

## Structure guidelines

- Start each page with a short summary and a clear goal.
- Use headings to break long sections into 3–5 line chunks.
- Include decision points and ownership for technical docs.

## Code blocks

Use code blocks to explain integrations, API usage, and system behavior.

```ts
import { api } from "@mindgrid/api/client";

const session = await api.auth.getSession();
if (!session.user) {
  throw new Error("Unauthenticated");
}
```

## Callout cards

Use cards to link to related topics or highlight next steps.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Product overview" href="/docs/product-overview" />
  <Card title="Release readiness" href="/docs/release-readiness" />
</Cards>

## Status tags

When a section is not complete, include a status line at the top of the
section to avoid ambiguity. Example:

> **Status:** In review (owner: Platform team)
