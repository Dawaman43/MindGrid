Welcome to the MindGrid documentation hub. This space brings together the
product narrative, engineering standards, and delivery checklists your team
needs to build and ship with confidence.

## Start here

- **Product overview:** Understand the core workflows, navigation, and feature
  areas.
- **Engineering architecture:** Review how services, packages, and runtime
  responsibilities are split.
- **Release readiness:** Use the shared checklist before shipping new features.

## What is MindGrid?

MindGrid helps teams capture ideas, turn them into structured plans, and keep
everyone aligned across web and native experiences. The platform is powered by
typed APIs, a shared domain model, and an extensible UI layer that keeps product
velocity high without sacrificing quality.

## Quick start checklist

1. Review the **Product overview** to understand the core workflows.
2. Read the **Backend & API Design** doc to align on the architecture.
3. Use **Implementation workflows** to plan delivery and documentation.
4. Check the roadmap section in each doc before starting implementation work.
