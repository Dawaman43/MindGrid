description: Core workflows, personas, and success metrics for MindGrid.
---

MindGrid helps teams turn ideas into structured plans that are easy to share,
track, and execute. This page outlines the product intent and the scenarios the
platform is optimized for.

## Core workflows

1. **Capture:** Create nodes quickly as ideas, tasks, or notes.
2. **Connect:** Link nodes into grids to show relationships and dependencies.
3. **Align:** Share grids with stakeholders and keep decisions documented.
4. **Deliver:** Track progress from planning to execution in one workspace.

## Experience principles

- **Clarity first:** Always surface the next step and the owner of a decision.
- **Frictionless capture:** Reduce steps to add, tag, and connect ideas.
- **Confidence in delivery:** Provide visibility into status and dependencies.

## Primary personas

- **Product leads:** Use MindGrid to align on scope, milestones, and tradeoffs.
- **Design & research:** Capture insights and map them to product outcomes.
- **Engineering:** Translate plans into actionable implementation sequences.

## Success metrics

- Time from idea capture to actionable plan.
- Fewer handoff gaps between product, design, and engineering.
- Faster launch readiness with shared documentation.

## Outcomes we optimize for

- Reduced duplication across planning docs and boards.
- Real-time alignment between product, design, and engineering.
- Visible progress for every active grid.

## Key surfaces

- **Workspace dashboard:** A shared entry point for cross-team work.
- **Grid view:** The primary canvas for mapping ideas and dependencies.
- **Activity stream:** The timeline of updates, decisions, and approvals.
