This guide describes the end-to-end workflow used by MindGrid teams when
shipping new features. Follow these steps to keep product, design, and
engineering aligned.

## 1. Scope and alignment

- Document the user problem and desired outcome.
- Identify dependencies across web, mobile, and platform teams.
- Confirm the data model changes and API surface requirements.

## 2. Design and validation

- Create low-fidelity flows and validate with stakeholders.
- Define the minimum viable grid interactions required.
- Capture accessibility requirements and UX edge cases.

## 3. Build plan

- Break work into product, platform, web, and mobile streams.
- Define the release target and milestone checkpoints.
- Assign owners for code, QA, and documentation updates.

## 4. Execution

- Ship API and schema work first to unblock clients.
- Implement UI flows in parallel with integration testing.
- Add telemetry for critical user actions and failure states.

## 5. Documentation updates

- Update feature docs and add release notes.
- Record any breaking changes or migration guidance.
- Link new pages from the documentation index.

## 6. Release readiness

- Confirm the [release readiness checklist](/docs/release-readiness).
- Run post-launch monitoring for 48 hours.
- Capture lessons learned and backlog follow-ups.
